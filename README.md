About Tesseract OCR -> 
Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is an open-source OCR engine that converts images of text — including handwriting and printed text — into machine-readable text.

Originally developed by HP Labs in the 1980s

Maintained and improved by Google since 2006

Supports 100+ languages (English, Hindi, etc.)

Works on printed and, to some extent, handwritten text

Why it’s popular

Free & open-source → No licensing costs

Cross-platform → Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and in browsers

Language training → Can be trained for custom fonts or symbols

JavaScript support → Using the library tesseract.js, you can run it in browsers or Node.js without installing native binaries

How it works (in simple steps)

Image preprocessing (optional but helps accuracy) – e.g., convert to grayscale, adjust contrast

Segmentation – splits image into lines, words, and characters

Feature extraction & classification – matches shapes against trained language data

Post-processing – corrects errors based on dictionary lookups

Use cases

Reading scanned documents

Extracting text from photos

Handwriting recognition in games/apps (like your Brain Domain project)

Real-time OCR in mobile or web apps
